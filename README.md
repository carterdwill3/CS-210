# CS-210
_Summarize the project and what problem it was solving._
I created a simple math application that asks users to enter a number and outputs the multiplication table for that value. The application also displays the outcome after doubling the input number's value.

_What did you do particularly well?_
Through this project, I was able to effectively develop a working investment calculator that computes the amount based on a variety of user inputs. I'm proudÂ in my ability to simplify and make a user-friendly interface out of complicated financial principles.

_Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?_
To guarantee that the user submits proper inputs, error handling should be added. To avoid frequent errors like inserting letters or special characters, I should also think about implementing a more powerful input validation system. Enhancing error management and validation would improve the program's usability and lower error rates.

_Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?_
The hardest part, in my opinion, always comes to the loops. In order to get around this, I went through my lecture notes from class and checked out internet resources like Stack Overflow and the C++ documentation. To boost my confidence, I also tried writing comparable computations in various contexts.

_What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?_
Any programming project needs the abilities I gained from this project, like data validation and problem-solving. These abilities can be used to other projects involving complicated computations or human input.

_How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?_
I recommended using sensible variable names [TO YOU] and dividing complicated logic into smaller functions to make the program readable. I always find that by breaking the software up into several areas (such as input validation, output, etc.), I also attempted to isolate problems. Because of the organization, it helps in comprehending and altering certain sections of the code without compromising the functionality of the entire program.
